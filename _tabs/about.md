Hey there!

I'm Pawe≈Ç, a software developer straight from Poland, now shakin' it up at RBI (Burger King, Popeyes, Tim Hortons). I started out as a front-end developer using React.js in 2017, but now I'm all about the back-end Node.js scene, mainly NestJS and AWS. But that's not all about me - I'm also a jazz guitar player, who says techies can't have soul?

I created this page to share my tech adventures, and hopefully not forget the cool things I've accomplished along the way. Plus, if anyone finds it interesting, that's just a bonus.

So, if you like what you see, give me a shout. And if you have any questions, don't be shy. Let's chat!

Cheers and happy reading!
